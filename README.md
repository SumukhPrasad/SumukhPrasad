# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 14 y/o student, full-stack developer and questionably attracted to the Information Superhighway.

I'm well versed in NodeJS, Python, Ruby, Swift, C/C++, MongoDB, and Svelte with about three years of experience in web development. I'm learning how I can change user experience by making boring things fun to do.

**Projects I'm collaborating on:**
- **Rhapsody**, a musical bot for Discord

**Projects I'm planning:**
- **Outreach**, a web application for social things like surveys, forms, etc. that can be attached to actions on the backend.
- **CodePlaygrounds**, a web-pased playground app for code
