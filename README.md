# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 16 y/o student and hobbiyist developer, and I'm questionably attracted to the Information Superhighway.


I'm constantly learning how I can change user experience by making boring things fun to do. 

<sub>And maybe making hilariously overkill solutions to problems that probably don't exist.</sub>
