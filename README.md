# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 16 y/o student, full-stack developer and questionably attracted to the Information Superhighway.

I'm well versed in NodeJS, Python, Ruby, Swift, C/C++, MongoDB, and Svelte with about three years of experience in web development. I'm learning how I can change user experience by making boring things fun to do.
