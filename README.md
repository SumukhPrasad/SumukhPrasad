# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
Student, hobbyist developer, questionably attracted to the [Information Superhighway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_superhighway).


I'm constantly learning how I can change user experience by making boring things fun to do. 

<sub>And maybe making hilariously overkill solutions to problems that probably don't exist.</sub>
